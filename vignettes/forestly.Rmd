# Introduction

The `forestly` R package creates interactive forest plots for clinical trial analysis and reporting. The interactive forest plots include:
- AE-specific tables along with the AE proportion difference and its confidence interval visualized.
- AE listing tables corresponding to a selected AE.

Through its interactive features, users can:
- **Search** for the AE PT term or SOC term of interest.
- **Filter** AEs with an incidence greater than a specified percentage in one or more arms.
- **Sort** AEs from the smallest proportion or proportion difference to the largest.
- **Switch** between different AE-specific tables.
- **Drill down** to listings for subjects with the selected AE.

# Procedure to generate interactive forest plot

## Step 1: read the ADAM data

In the example presented in this vignette, we utilize the ADAM data from the `forestly` R package. We further factorize the actual arm variable, `TRTA`, to enable the `forestly` R package to identify which arm serves as the reference group.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(metalite)
library(forestly)

adsl <- forestly_adsl
adae <- forestly_adae

adsl$TRTA <- factor(forestly_adsl$TRT01A, 
                    levels = c("Xanomeline Low Dose", "Placebo"), 
                    labels = c("Low Dose", "Placebo"))
adae$TRTA <- factor(forestly_adae$TRTA, 
                    levels = c("Xanomeline Low Dose", "Placebo"), 
                    labels = c("Low Dose", "Placebo"))
```

## Step 2: build the metadata

We use the [metalite](https://merck.github.io/metalite/) R package to generate a minimal metadata for the generation of the interactive forest plot.

To begin, we input the `adsl` data as the population data and the `adae` data as the observation data. 
```{r}
meta <- meta_adam(population = adsl, observation = adae)
```

Without loss of generality, our plan is to generate the following four AE-specific tables:
- Any AE (we give it a short name/nickname as `"any"`)
- Drug-related AE (we give it a short name/nickname as `"drug-related"`)
- Serious AE (we give it a short name/nickname as `"serious"`)
- Drug-related serious AE (we give it a short name/nickname as `"drug-related-serious"`)
However, users are allowed to add more AE-specific tables as needed. For the above 4 AE specific tables, we take the APaT for both observation and observation. 
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_plan(plan = plan(analysis = "ae_forestly", 
                          population = "apat",
                          observation = "apat", 
                          parameter = "any;drug-related;serious;drug-related-serious")) 
```

Following the definition of the analysis plan, we further specify the details of `analysis = "ae_forestly"` by providing its label for display.
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_analysis(name = "ae_forestly", label = "Interactive Forest Plot") 
```

We then define the related population (`population = "apat"`) and observation (`observation = "apat"`) by specifying their grouping variable (`group = ...`), subject ID (`id = ...`), population flag (`subset = ...`) and label (`label = ...`). If users wish to use different population flags, grouping variables, or labels, they can make changes as needed.
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_population(name = "apat", group = "TRTA", id = "USUBJID",
                    subset = SAFFL == "Y", label = "All Patient as Treated") |>
  define_observation(name = "apat", group = "TRTA", 
                     subset = SAFFL == "Y", label = "All Patient as Treated") 
```

Next, we specify the details of `parameter = "any;drug-related;serious;drug-related-serious"`. For any AEs (`"any"`), their is no filter applied. 
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_parameter(name = "any", 
                   subset = NULL,
                   label = "Any AEs", 
                   var = "AEDECOD", soc = "AEBODSYS")
```
For drug related AEs (`"drug-related"`), its filter is `AEREL %in% c("PROBABLE", "POSSIBLE")`.
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_parameter(name = "drug-related", 
                   subset = toupper(AREL) == "RELATED",
                   label = "Drug-related AEs", 
                   var = "AEDECOD", soc = "AEBODSYS") 
```
Similarly, we define serious AE and drug related serious AEs.
```{r}
meta <- meta |>
  define_parameter(name = "serious", 
                   subset = AESER == "Y",
                   label = "Serious AEs", 
                   var = "AEDECOD", soc = "AEBODSYS") |>
  define_parameter(name = "drug-related-serious", 
                   subset = AESER == "Y" & AEREL %in% c("PROBABLE", "POSSIBLE"),
                   label = "Drug-related serious AEs", 
                   var = "AEDECOD", soc = "AEBODSYS") 
```

Finally, we build the metadata by running the `meta_build()` function.
```{r}
meta <- meta |>  meta_build()
```

## Step 3: generate the interative AE forest plot

With the `meta` built as described above, users can generate the interactive AE forest seamlessly through a few simple function calls connected with the pipe operator (`|>`). The `prepare_ae_forestly()` prepares datasets (i.e., calculate all to-be-reported numbers). The `format_ae_forestly()` takes care of formating, and the `ae_forestly()` function realize the interactivity.
```{r}
meta |>
  prepare_ae_forestly() |>
  format_ae_forestly() |>
  ae_forestly()
```
